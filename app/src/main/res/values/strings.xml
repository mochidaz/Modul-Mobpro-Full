        The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is an operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually vectors) and returns a single number. This operation multiplies corresponding elements of the vectors and sums the results. Mathematically, for two vectors a and b with components a_i and b_i, the dot product is defined as:
        a · b = a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + … + an * bn
        Geometrically, the dot product of two vectors also equals the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them:
        a · b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)
        where |a| and |b| are the magnitudes of a and b, and θ is the angle between them. The dot product is widely used in physics, engineering, and computer graphics to project vectors, calculate angles, and determine orthogonality.
